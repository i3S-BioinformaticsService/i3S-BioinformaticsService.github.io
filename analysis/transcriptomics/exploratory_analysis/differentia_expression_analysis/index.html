      Differential expression (DE) analysis is one of the most common applications of RNA-seq data. In its essence, DE analysis compares gene abundances between two conditions determining which genes are pressed at different levels. These genes can offere biological insight into the biological processes taking place between the condition of interest. The difference of expression between conditions is expressed as the logarithm of the fold change between condition. Significance is determined by a means of a Wald test which determines whether the difference in read counts it is greater than what would be expected just due to natural random variation. These p-valies are then corrected by Benjamini-Hochberg method for multiple correction.
